description: "The Skylark of Space is a science fiction novel by American writer Edward\
  \ E. \"Doc\" Smith, written between 1915 and 1921 while Smith was working on his\
  \ doctorate. Though the original idea for the novel was Smith's, he co-wrote the\
  \ first part of the novel with Lee Hawkins Garby, the wife of his college classmate\
  \ and later neighbor Carl Garby. The novel starts as an edisonade, but turns into\
  \ a space travel adventure when the characters goes into deep space. The Skylark\
  \ of Space is considered to be one of the earliest novels of interstellar travel\
  \ and the first example of space opera. Originally serialized in 1928 in the magazine\
  \ Amazing Stories, it was first published in book form in 1946 by the Buffalo Book\
  \ Co. The novel was followed by three sequels, beginning with Skylark Three.\n From\
